This is a game project for CA1 of Software Engineering in my MSc in Computer Animation at DKIT. 
It is my first ever attempt at coding and programming in general.
I am using a Mac, and had trouble getting Raylib to work in VS Code, so Clion was used instead to run Raylib.
The tutorial I used to make Raylib function used C99, and further problems arose whilst trying to implement C++. Thus, C++ was not used for this project.

Here is a list of all resources used throughout the project aside from college lectures:
