This is a game project for CA1 of Software Engineering.
I am using a Mac, and had trouble getting Raylib to work in VS Code, so Clion was used instead to run Raylib.
The tutorial I used to make Raylib function used C99, and thus C++ was not used for this project.

Here is a list of all resources used throughout the project aside from college lectures: 

For installing Raylib on Clion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ-ZUL1mONU&t=421s
